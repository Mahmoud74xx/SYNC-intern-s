AI Tasks

Task 1: Plant Disease Detection: The aim of this code is to build, training, and evaluating a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras for classifying plant diseases. 

Task 2:  Handwritten Digit recognition: The aim of this code is to recognize handwritten digits. It starts by preparing the data, constructs a neural network, trains it to understand patterns in the images, checks its learning progress, and then applies it to predict digits in new, unseen images.
